### 1. It's an amazing opportunity
<p>When I found out I had been accepted to Access Code, I felt a little like I had won the lottery. I had been lost in the rabbit hole of self-study for so long. Each new piece of code knowledge increased my curiosity but also my awareness of how much <i>more</i> there was to learn. I had no idea how to steer my pursuit in a direction that would ever turn it into a career. </p>

<p>Enter: Access Code. We had our first classes over the weekend, and Saturday and Sunday were both such special days. It was so much fun to meet the students, TA's and staff and to begin to learn the stories that brought us all together.</p>

<p>It's rare that I've had the chance to be in a classroom where everyone is truly engaged and excited to be there, and it's a wonderful feeling to find such a place. </p>

### 2. Balancing work and education is hard!

<p>Access Code is awesome in-part because it fills a major gap: a bootcamp-style program for people who are serious about making a career change to tech but can't afford, or aren't able, to leave their jobs / school for a full-time program.</p>

<p>Normally, I work evenings from 3:00p - 11:00p, so I'm a bit of a night owl. My job has been accommodative by allowing me to work earlier in the day on Tuesdays and Thursdays so I can attend the program. This week, I got my first taste of what a challenge this schedule will be.</p>

<p>Tuesday, in particular, was rough. I didn't sleep much the night before and got up just before 7:00 to head to work. In a sort of sleepy, zombie-esque haze, I guzzled several mugs of coffee in the morning so that by the time the afternoon rolled around I was feeling jittery and weak. And then the snow started.</p>

<p>Since I work in south Brooklyn, I borrowed a friend's car in hopes of shortening the commute from work to Long Island City. Instead I ended up in an icy 90-minute crawl along the BQE.<p>

<p>By the time I arrived, I was pretty drained. It was hard to focus on the code in front of me, which made me a less-than-ideal partner for pair programming.</p>

<p>Optimizing my weekdays is key to getting the most out of Access Code. The most obvious steps are sleeping and eating well. I'm looking forward to spring weather so I can start biking again, which should make the commute more pleasant. And in next couple of months, I'll look into cutting back my schedule at work to create more time for learning.</p>

### 3. Learning to code is only part of it

<p>On our program schedule, the first few months of Access Code are about learning Java and mastering the basics of app building. Saturday's talks by Paola and Kevin emphasized how much there is to learn beyond the paper schedule.</p>

<p>Kevin iterated the importance that networking will play in our careers. While coding chops are important, it'll be the community around us that ultimately determines our success. Going to events, participating in meetups, and building a social media presence are just a few things we can do to enrich that community.</p>

<p>Paola's story was especially inspirational to me. I can totally relate to feeling bored and lost in a job, and how far-fetched it can seem to dream for something better. Getting into Access Code was the first step for Paola, and her adaptability and perseverance kept her going to where she is today.</p>
