It's hard to believe we're already through the first month of Access Code. Soon we'll be wrapping up our Java basics and getting started on our first Android app.

Lately, time has been a precious resource. Between working full-time, attending class and completing homework, time left over has been pretty slim. I don't think there's an easy solution to this: no matter what, the next 8 months are going to be hard and will require a ton of grit to persevere.

Since I've got apps on my mind, I wanted to talk about a few that I've found really helpful for staying organized and managing my time.


### Pocket

I really like Pocket. It's an app that lets you save content from the web for offline viewing. When you find something you want to save, just click a button in the browser and Pocket automatically downloads the content (webpage, video, PDF, whatever) to your phone/tablet.

I spend a lot of time commuting on the subway these days. By saving tutorials, code documentation, news articles or anything I want to read so that it's available offline, it's easy to make more productive use of those commute hours.

### Beeminder

I haven't been using Beeminder as much since Access Code has been keeping me so busy, but when I was trying to learn to code on my own, I found Beeminder to be a handy tool for setting and following through on goals.

The goal-tracking interface is a little confusing at first, but it doesn't take long to figure it out (just stay above the line!). Beeminder can also integrate with other sites like GitHub and CodeSchool to automatically track your progress on those sites.

### Jawbone Up

Jawbone Up is the app that records and graphs data collected by a Jawbone fitness tracker. I got a pretty good deal on an UP 24 band a couple of months ago. I wanted it for the 'silent alarm' (just buzzes on your wrist to wake you up) and sleep tracking features, but have since found the activity tracking features interesting as well.

I'm definitely still lacking sleep (I know this because my Jawbone band has began to send concerned emails, saying things like: "You've hit your sleep goal: 0 times."). Having a record of my sleep and wake times has made it easier to inch my bedtime earlier so that, maybe one day, I'll make that goal.

It's cool to have a visual record of your sleep and activity patterns -- it makes clear how small changes to your day-to-day habits can have big results over time.

### A paper notebook

I use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for my more 'extensive' note taking, but still, I've found keeping a paper notebook to be pretty invaluable these days.

Paper notebooks are especially useful for communicating ideas while pair programming. Having a place to draw out ideas by hand, sketch flow charts and write pseudocode can help elucidate complex ideas and get programming partners on the same page, no pun intended.
